TEMPLATES

Edits:
move calling of JS function on api_campers entirely to the Detail page, it's currently happening in the logged in template

add  navbar with Profile and Logout buttons to header, right side (with breadcrumbs on left) -- try building in static html page example first, this could get complex
dynamically generate breadcrumbs (not sure how)

ADMINISTRATIVE AREA

Create various levels of admin privileges

Reports:
Find out most important reports to create
Create premade reporting functions for each of these
optional/if time: implement custom reporting features

Modifying data:
Changing payment info based on offline payments (e.g. if someone sends in a check, or if their fee is waived for being a volunteer or speaker)
Changing info for a given person if they request it
Maybe have an upper level of admin who can add other admins, so I don't have to be in charge of it

Webmaster management:
Find out if there's a way I can create accounts and require them to change their password on first login? 


USER FEATURES

create user profile page (see below)
add logout to every page



PAGES

Create views and templates for the family login area (profile, housing preferences, scholarship and discount page, payment page) and admin area (need to create full list still)

Flesh out logged-in-template to include a better top bar, a side bar that includes the amount they owe


JAVASCRIPT

Major cleanup needed for draw-detail.js. Includes breaking down existing functions into multiple functions, turning repetitive code into for loops, and replacing raw HTML string outputs with createElement. 

Add form validation and event listeners to every page
