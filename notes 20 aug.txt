notes 8/20 

did today:
==========

got POST to work for vegetarian checkbox, DOB fields on Detail
worked on js challenge; took notes on stuff to know for similar challenges

created SchoolGroup and Grade models
created a Fixture in JSON to auto-load the above

need to do to follow up on the above:
=====================================

create a loop to get all fields to post on Detail page

change "grade" field to a dropdown list that uses the "grades" table, use JS to show the person's grade when page loads, and add "not in school" as the default grade on the model

create default="none" for the sponsor name and phone attributes in models.py, and hook these up to the form


Stuff to clean up:
=================

(good project for when I'm feeling tired/unfocused. Get rid of thing and test to make sure still works)

get rid of unused views, models, and templates. 

get rid of commented out code everywhere

go through existing models. remove unused fields/variables/methods. 
Add csrf and login_required decorators where needed.
